# LibraryÂ´s database
#### A database for a library that sell and rent books, with clients, authors, books and transactions tables.

This is from the [MySql course][2], we create the db from nothing, add registers, and then we switched to an already full database for some complex queries.

I worked on the shell, so theres the txt where I did queries for copy them into the cmd.

Also, theres the full db that we used. We did some real business cases, many of them were given in the course, and others were invented for myself.
